**Understanding setTimeout in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, the `setTimeout` function is a commonly used method for scheduling the execution of a function after a specified amount of time has passed. This allows developers to delay the execution of certain tasks, which can be useful for animations, asynchronous operations, or any situation where timing is important.

**Code Overview**

Let's break down the code to understand how `setTimeout` is utilized within it.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Chai aur Code</h1>
    <button id="stop">Stop</button>
  </body>
  <script>
    // Function to log a name to the console
    const sayMyName = function () {
      console.log("shivam");
    };

    // Function to change the text of the <h1> element
    const changeText = function () {
      document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Best JS series";
    };

    // Using setTimeout to schedule the changeText function to execute after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
    const changeMe = setTimeout(changeText, 2000);

    // Adding event listener to the button with id "stop"
    document.querySelector("#stop").addEventListener("click", () => {
      // Clearing the timeout set by setTimeout when the button is clicked
      clearTimeout(changeMe);
      console.log("STOPPED");
    });
  </script>
</html>
```

**Explanation**

1. **Defining Functions**: The code starts by defining two functions: `sayMyName` and `changeText`.

   - `sayMyName` is a simple function that logs the name "shivam" to the console.
   - `changeText` is a function that changes the innerHTML of the `<h1>` element to "Best JS series".

2. **setTimeout Usage**:

   - The `setTimeout` function is then used to schedule the `changeText` function to execute after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). This is achieved by passing the `changeText` function and the delay of 2000 milliseconds as arguments to `setTimeout`.

3. **Event Handling**:

   - An event listener is added to the button with the id "stop". When this button is clicked, it triggers the function defined using an arrow function.
   - Within this function, `clearTimeout` is called with the `changeMe` variable as an argument. This effectively cancels the execution of the `changeText` function that was scheduled using `setTimeout`.

4. **Console Feedback**:
   - Additionally, when the button is clicked, "STOPPED" is logged to the console to provide feedback that the timeout has been cleared.

In summary, this code demonstrates the usage of `setTimeout` to delay the execution of a function, and how `clearTimeout` can be used to cancel this scheduled execution.
