### Static Members in JavaScript Classes

#### Definition and Purpose

Static members in JavaScript classes are properties or methods that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They are accessed directly from the class and not from instances of the class.

#### Static Property: `count`

The `count` property in the `User` class is declared as static. It keeps track of the number of instances created from the `User` class. Each time a new instance is created, the `count` is incremented.

```javascript
static count = 0;

constructor(username) {
  this.username = username;
  User.count++;
}
```

#### Static Method: `createId()`

The `createId()` method in the `User` class is declared as static. It generates and returns an ID. Static methods are often utility functions or methods that are common to all instances of the class.

```javascript
static createId() {
  return `123`;
}
```

#### Accessing Static Members

Static members are accessed directly from the class, not from instances of the class.

```javascript
console.log(User.createId()); // Output: "123"
console.log(User.count); // Output: 2
```

#### Inheritance of Static Members

Static members are also inherited by subclasses. In the `Teacher` subclass, the `createId()` method inherited from the `User` class is accessible.

```javascript
const iphone = new Teacher("iphone", "i@phone.com");
console.log(iphone.createId()); // Output: "123"
```

### Conclusion

Static members in JavaScript classes provide a way to define properties and methods that belong to the class itself rather than to individual instances. They are useful for storing common data or behavior that is not specific to any particular instance. Static members can be accessed directly from the class and are also inherited by subclasses.
