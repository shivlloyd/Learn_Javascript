### Classes in JavaScript: ES6 Syntax vs. Prototype-based Approach

#### ES6 Syntax: Class Declaration

In ES6, JavaScript introduced a more structured way to define classes using the `class` keyword. This syntax provides a cleaner and more familiar syntax for object-oriented programming.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(username, email, password) {
    this.username = username;
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
  }

  encriptPassword() {
    return `${this.password}abc`;
  }
  changeUsername() {
    return `${this.username.toUpperCase()}`;
  }
}

const user1 = new User("shivam", "shivam@xyz.com", "123");

console.log(user1.encriptPassword());
console.log(user1.changeUsername());
```

#### Prototype-based Approach

Before ES6, JavaScript used a prototype-based approach to create classes and inheritance. Here's how the same functionality would be implemented using this approach:

```javascript
function User(username, email, password) {
  this.username = username;
  this.email = email;
  this.password = password;
}

User.prototype.encryptPassword = function () {
  return `${this.password}abc`;
};

User.prototype.changeUsername = function () {
  return `${this.username.toUpperCase()}`;
};

const user2 = new User("amit", "amit@xyz.com", "567");

console.log(user2.encryptPassword());
console.log(user2.changeUsername());
```

### Key Differences

#### Syntax

- **ES6 Syntax:** Utilizes the `class` keyword to declare classes, offering a more intuitive syntax for developers accustomed to class-based languages.
- **Prototype-based Approach:** Relies on constructor functions and prototype chains to achieve object-oriented behavior.

#### Constructor

- **ES6 Syntax:** Constructors are defined using the `constructor` method within the class declaration.
- **Prototype-based Approach:** Constructor functions are defined separately from the class body.

#### Methods

- **ES6 Syntax:** Class methods are defined within the class body using standard function syntax.
- **Prototype-based Approach:** Methods are added to the prototype chain using the `prototype` property of the constructor function.

### Conclusion

While both approaches achieve similar results, the ES6 class syntax provides a more elegant and concise way to work with classes in JavaScript, making code more readable and maintainable for developers. However, it's essential to understand the underlying prototype-based model as it forms the foundation of JavaScript's object-oriented programming paradigm.
