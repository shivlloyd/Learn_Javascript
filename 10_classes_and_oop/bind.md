# Bind in javascript

#### Introduction to `bind()`

The `bind()` method in JavaScript is used to create a new function with a specified `this` value and, optionally, initial arguments. It essentially allows you to set the value of `this` for a function when it is invoked.

#### Scenario in the Code

In the provided code snippet, the `bind()` method is utilized to ensure that the `this` keyword inside the `handleClick()` method refers to the instance of the `React` class.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - An instance of the `React` class (`app`) is created.
2. **Event Listener Binding**:
   - Within the `constructor` of the `React` class, an event listener is attached to the button element.
   - The event listener listens for a "click" event and invokes the `handleClick()` method.
   - Without using `bind()`, `this` inside `handleClick()` would refer to the button element itself when the event is triggered, which is not desired.
3. **`handleClick()` Method**:
   - This method is defined within the `React` class.
   - It logs "button clicked !" to the console when the button is clicked.
   - It also logs `this`, which should refer to the instance of the `React` class.

#### Importance of `bind()`

Using `bind()` ensures that the `this` context inside the `handleClick()` method remains bound to the instance of the `React` class, enabling access to class properties and methods within the event handler.

#### Conclusion

In JavaScript, `bind()` is a crucial method for managing the context of `this` within functions. It allows for more predictable behavior, especially in scenarios like event handling, where the context might otherwise be lost.
