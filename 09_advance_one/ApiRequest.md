### Explaining XMLHttpRequest and API Requests in HTML

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API in the form of an object that allows JavaScript code to asynchronously make HTTP requests to a server. This capability enables web pages to dynamically update content without needing to reload the entire page. In the provided HTML code snippet, an XMLHttpRequest object is used to fetch data from the GitHub API and display it on a web page.

#### HTML Structure and Styling

The HTML structure consists of a simple card layout, styled using CSS. The card contains an image, a container for user data, and placeholders for the user's name, follower count, and bio. CSS styles define the appearance of the card, including its shadow effects and padding.

#### Making the API Request

The JavaScript code initiates an XMLHttpRequest to retrieve data from the GitHub API. It targets the profile of a GitHub user named "shivlloyd" by specifying the URL as `https://api.github.com/users/shivlloyd`. The request is set to a GET method.

#### Handling the XMLHttpRequest Events

The `onreadystatechange` event handler is used to define a function that will be called whenever the `readyState` property of the XMLHttpRequest object changes. The `readyState` property indicates the current state of the request, with values ranging from 0 to 4, each representing a different stage of the request process.

- **0 (UNSENT):** The client has been created, but `open()` has not been called yet.
- **1 (OPENED):** The request has been opened with `open()`.
- **2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED):** Headers and status are available after `send()` has been called.
- **3 (LOADING):** Data is being downloaded, and `responseText` holds partial data.
- **4 (DONE):** The operation is complete.

#### Processing the Response

When the `readyState` reaches 4, indicating that the operation is complete, the code parses the response text from JSON format to a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`. The parsed data contains information about the GitHub user.

#### Updating the DOM

Finally, the JavaScript code updates the HTML elements within the card with the fetched user data. It sets the `src` attribute of the image element to the user's avatar URL, updates the text content of the name, follower count, and bio elements with the corresponding user data retrieved from the API response.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use XMLHttpRequest to make API requests and dynamically update the content of a web page based on the received data.
