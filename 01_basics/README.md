# Setting Up JavaScript Environment with Node.js

JavaScript, originally a programming language for web browsers, has evolved to run on local machines using Node.js. Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime environment that can be used for versatile tasks, including server-side development, command-line tools, and applications beyond traditional web browser environments.

## Installation

1. **Install Node.js:**

   - Download the compatible version for your OS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
   - Follow the installation instructions with default settings.

2. **Create Your First JavaScript File:**

   - Choose a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom).
   - Create a new file, save it with a `.js` extension (e.g., `test.js`).
   - Write JavaScript code in the file. For example:
     ```javascript
     console.log("shivam");
     ```

3. **Execute JavaScript File:**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your JavaScript file using the `cd` command.
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/directory
     ```
   - Run the file with the following command:
     ```bash
     node test.js
     ```

4. **View Output:**
   - Check the terminal for the output:
     ```bash
     shivam
     ```

## Next Steps

Now that Node.js is set up on your local machine, you can explore various applications of JavaScript, from server-side development to building command-line tools. This environment opens up new possibilities for leveraging the power of JavaScript beyond traditional web development.

Feel free to dive deeper into Node.js documentation and tutorials to enhance your skills and broaden your understanding of JavaScript development.

Happy coding!
